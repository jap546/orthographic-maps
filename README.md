# orthographic-maps

Few examples of orthographic maps. 

Broadly following this example [here](https://dominicroye.github.io/en/2023/tomorrows-weather/). 

### Temperature example

Temperature 2m data was sourced from Copernicus for the month of [June, 2023](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/seasonal-original-single-levels?tab=form). This was then average across the entire month. 

### Sea ice example

[Arctic sea ice data](https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/product/ARCTIC_ANALYSISFORECAST_PHY_ICE_002_011/description) was extracted from the Copernicus marine data store, where data for [September 2022 was used](https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/product/ARCTIC_ANALYSISFORECAST_PHY_ICE_002_011/files?path=ARCTIC_ANALYSISFORECAST_PHY_ICE_002_011%2Fcmems_mod_arc_phy_anfc_nextsim_P1M-m_202211%2F2022%2F&subdataset=cmems_mod_arc_phy_anfc_nextsim_P1M-m_202211). 

September median sea ice extent from 1981 - 2010 was sourced from the [Sea Ice Index](https://nsidc.org/data/seaice_index).
